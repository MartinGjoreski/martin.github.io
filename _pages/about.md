PhD candidate at the Department of Intelligent Systems at the Jozef Stefan Institute. My research field is AI with focus on development of standard machine learning and deep learning methods for sensor data. I am particularly interested in applications in fields such as affective computing, ambient intelligence, mobile healthcare and wearable computing. I am also a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana. Subjects: Mobile Computing and Platform Based Development.<br/>
