I am a postdoc researcher at the Faculty of Informatics, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), in the[research group](https://pc.inf.usi.ch/) of prof. Marc Langheinrich and prof. Silvia Santini. My research field is AI with focus on development of standard machine learning and deep learning methods for sensor data. I am particularly interested in applications in fields such as mobile and wearable computing, behavioural analytics, affective computing, and mobile healthcare. I did my PhD at the Department of Intelligent Systems at the Jozef Stefan Institute. I was also a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana.
