I am a postdoc researcher at the Faculty of Informatics, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), in the [research group](https://pc.inf.usi.ch/) of prof. Marc Langheinrich. My research field is AI with a focus on the development of standard machine learning and deep learning methods for sensor data. I am particularly interested in applications in fields such as mobile and wearable computing, behavioural analytics, affective computing, and mobile healthcare. From 2014 to 2020, I was part of the [Department of Intelligent Systems](https://dis.ijs.si/) at the Jozef Stefan Institute, where I did my MSc and PhD studies under the supervision of prof. Matjaz Gams and prof. Mitja Lustrek. In the years of 2019 and 2020, was also a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana. More details about my teaching activities are available [here.](https://martingjoreski.github.io/teaching/)
